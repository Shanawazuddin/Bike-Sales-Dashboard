# Sales Data Analysis Dashboard
## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing sales data to uncover insights related to customer demographics, purchase patterns, and overall sales performance. The project was done using Microsoft Excel, with a focus on cleaning data, applying formulas for analysis, and visualizing insights through a dynamic dashboard.
Files in the Repository
1.	Excel Project Dataset.xlsx: [The raw dataset file that contains the unprocessed sales and customer data.](https://github.com/Shanawazuddin/Bike-Sales-Dashboard/blob/main/Excel%20Raw%20Dataset.xlsx)
2.	Excel Project Dashboard.xlsx: [The processed and analyzed data presented in the form of an interactive Excel dashboard.](https://github.com/Shanawazuddin/Bike-Sales-Dashboard/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dashboard.xlsx)

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the [Project Dataset.xlsx](https://github.com/Shanawazuddin/Bike-Sales-Dashboard/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dashboard.xlsx), the following data cleaning steps were performed:

•	Removal of Duplicates: Ensured that there were no duplicate entries in the dataset to maintain data accuracy.

•	Handling Missing Values: Missing or incomplete values were addressed by either removing rows with insufficient data or filling gaps where applicable.

•	Reformatting Data: Standardized date formats, product names, and customer IDs to ensure consistency across the dataset.

## Formulas Used
Several Excel formulas were applied to derive key insights from the data:

•	SUMIFS: Used to calculate total sales by specific criteria such as gender, region, and product type.
•	AVERAGEIFS: Applied to find the average income per purchase, filtered by customer segments.
•	VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP: Utilized to search and cross-reference data from different tables.
•	COUNTIF: Employed to count occurrences of specific data points such as number of purchases made by each customer.
•	IFERROR: Integrated to handle errors resulting from calculations or missing data during analysis.
